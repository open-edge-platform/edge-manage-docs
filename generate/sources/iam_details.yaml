service-admin-group: Maintains the Edge Orchestration software including the IAM, and third-party components of Edge Orchestrator (Rancher\* platform, and so on).

alerts-m2m-service-account: Used internally to allow the alert system to read the user list. Do not place users in this group.

apps-m2m-service-account: Used internally to allow communication between application and cluster services.  Do not place users in this group.

host-manager-m2m-service-account: Used internally in the Edge Orchestrator for edge node onboarding and provisioning. Do not place users in this group.

## Org specific

<org-id>_Project-Manager-Group: Can create, update, and delete Projects. Organization specific.

## Projects specific

<project-id>_Edge-Manager-Group: Can read or write cluster templates; import registry artifact; create, update, delete, or debug edge clusters; create, delete, and update deployments; create applications, profiles, and deployment packages; and upload Helm\* charts and container images.

<project-id>_Edge-Operator-Group: Can list, create, update, or delete existing deployments and list or debug edge clusters, but **not** define applications, profiles, cluster templates, and so on.

<project-id>_Edge-Onboarding-Group: Place users in this group who will onboard edge nodes through the password based method and without pre-registration. You must place a user **only** in a *single* edge onboarding group - the onboarded edge node will be added to this user's project.

Improve Documentation
---------------------

The easiest way to help with documentation, including the
:doc:`/developer_guide/index` and  :doc:`/user_guide/index`, is to review it
and provide feedback on the existing articles. Whether you notice a mistake,
see the possibility of improving the text, or think more information should be
added, you can reach out to discuss the potential changes.

See the `edge-manage-docs README for instructions on testing and building the
documentation <https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-manage-docs/>`_

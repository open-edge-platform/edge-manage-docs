Scalability
===========

On-Premise Edge Orchestrator is designed to be scalable to support large scale deployments.
This section provides an overview of the scalability considerations, support strategies,
and mechanisms used to achieve scalability.

Scalability Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On-Premise Edge Orchestrator supports scalability through the use of Kubernetes\* platform,
which allows for the deployment of applications to be scaled as needed.

Scalability Mechanisms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On-Premise Edge Orchestrator allows for scalability in the same way that other
Kubernetes applications do, using the underlying Kubernetes platform
(through RKE2 in this particular instance), which allows for the applications
deployed to be scaled as needed.

Trusted Compute
===============

Trusted Compute is a set of software-defined security extensions that utilize hardware security capabilities of the Edge Node within the Edge Manageability Framework.

A user can select and deploy trusted compute extensions on a node to achieve higher security assurances for their workloads. This extension enhances edge node protection through:

- **Continuous Monitoring** and
- **Workload Protection through Isolated Execution**

Trusted Compute is a key aspect of |software_prod_name| that provides workload protections of the system. This section provides a comprehensive view of
|software_prod_name| Trusted Compute extension and an overview of key components that help you monitor the trust status of the edge nodes and protect the workloads by isolated execution.

Testing Custom OS Profiles
==========================

By default, Edge Orchestrator creates a set of OS profiles (see
:doc:`/shared/shared_os_profile`).

However, it is sometimes desirable to test a custom OS Profile that is under
development, before officially releasing it as described in
:doc:`/user_guide/advanced_functionality/custom_os_profile.rst`.

This guide shows how to create an OS resource with a custom OS image on a live
instance of Edge Orchestrator.

Deploying Applications
======================

As outlined in the Developer Workflow :doc:`/developer_guide/application_developer_workflow/deploying-applications/index`,
we can now deploy the Tutorial Server and the Tutorial Web UI. This requires a running |software_prod_name| instance,
a multi-tenancy-project and cluster(s) configured on one or more Edge Nodes. The User Guide and Developer Guide have
details on these, and we will not repeat it here.

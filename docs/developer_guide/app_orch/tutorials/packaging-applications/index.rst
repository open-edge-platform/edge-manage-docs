Packaging Applications
=======================

As outlined in the Developer Workflow :doc:`/developer_guide/application_developer_workflow/packaging-applications/index`,
the next step is to package the application.

This is done using the `Docker\* <https://www.docker.com/>`_ **build** command to
create a Docker (container) image that can be deployed to the Application Orchestration platform.

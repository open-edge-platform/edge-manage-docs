Deployment
==========

The Application Orchestrator is deployed as a set of microservices in a
Kubernetes\* cluster. In the overall scope of the |software_prod_name|
installation, the microservices are deployed by the Argo\* CD tool, which is a GitOps
continuous delivery tool that ensures the platform is brought up quickly and
reliably.

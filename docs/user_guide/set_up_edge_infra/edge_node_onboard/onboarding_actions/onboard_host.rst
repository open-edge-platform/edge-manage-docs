Onboard Host
=====================================================================

The **Onboard Host** feature allows the User to onboard into the Edge Orchestrator a previously registered Host.

#. Go to the **Infrastructure tab**, click **Hosts** on the left menu and select the **Registered** tab.

   host, then click **Onboard**.

Once the node is onboarded, you can find it on the **Onboarded** tab.
Delete the host if you want to remove it from this page.

.. note:: You must still complete the onboarding process for the edge node for it to appear in the UI,
   but you do not have to enter a user name or password in the onboarding steps.

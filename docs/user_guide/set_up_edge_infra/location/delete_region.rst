Delete Region
==================

.. note::
   You cannot delete regions that are associated with any site.

   To delete regions that are the parents of any other regions, you must need to delete the sub-regions first.
   See sites and sub-regions in the region details
   :doc:`/user_guide/set_up_edge_infra/location/view_region_detail`.

To delete a region:

#. Go to the **Locations** page.
#. Find the **Region** you want to delete by expanding the hierarchy by clicking on `>` next to an existing region.
#. Click the three dots and then click **Delete**.

#. On the confirmation window, click **Delete**. The region will be deleted.

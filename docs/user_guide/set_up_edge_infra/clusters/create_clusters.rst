Create Cluster
=====================================

.. warning::

   **Multi-node cluster creation** is not supported.
   This limitation is expected to be resolved in a future release. For now, only single-node
   clusters can be created. We recommend factoring this in when making your future deployments.

.. warning::
   **DISRUPTIVE UPGRADE WARNING**
   Upgrade from 3.0 to 3.1 requires edge node re-onboarding due to architecture changes (RKE2 â†’ K3s).
   Plan for edge nodes service downtime and manual data backup/restore procedures in edge nodes.

In the **Create Cluster** feature, you can create a single-node cluster

with customizable settings. Within this setup, You have the option to:

* Select cluster templates to determine the desired cluster composition.


.. note::
   You can also create a single-node cluster during the host configuration
   process. For more information,
   see :doc:`/user_guide/set_up_edge_infra/edge_node_onboard/onboarding_actions/provision_host`.


To create a single node cluster, do the following:

1. On the **Cluster List** page, click **Create Cluster**. The **Create
   Cluster** page appears.

   .. figure:: ../images/create_cluster.png
      :width: 100 %
      :alt: Create Clusters

#. On the **Create Cluster** page, the first step is to **Specify Cluster Name
   and Template**:

   a. Enter the cluster name in the **Cluster Name** field.
   b. Select the cluster template in the **Cluster Template Name** field.
   c. Select the cluster template versions in the
      **Cluster Template Versions** field.

.. note::
   As part of cluster creation, you need to follow the naming convention:
   Cluster name only allows alphanumeric values and the
   special characters "." and "-". Incorrect naming will result
   in not being able to proceed to the last step of cluster creation.

#. Click **Next**. The **Select Site** step appears.

#. In the **Select Site** step, expand the regions by clicking on the ">" icon
   to view the sites and subregions contained within the region.
   Drill down to the site you are interested in and select the
   radio button next to the site name.

#. Click **Next**. The **Select Host & Roles** step appears.

   .. figure:: ../images/create_cluster_host.png
      :width: 100 %
      :alt: Create Cluster Select Site

#. A list of configured hosts that are part of the selected Site appears.
   Select one host by clicking the checkbox next to each host.

#. You may also select the **Role** that each host is assigned. The role
   selected here dictates which Kubernetes components are run on the host.
   Currently, only the **All** role, hosts both the Kubernetes control plane
   services and user applications, is supported for single-node clusters.

#. Click **Next**. The **Add Deployment Metadata** step appears.

#. In the **Add Deployment Metadata** step, label the cluster with metadata
   that will be used to identify targets for application deployment. In
   the **Key** and **Value** fields, select the metadata category and
   corresponding value. For more information about metadata,
   see :doc:`/user_guide/advanced_functionality/automated_deployment`.

   .. figure:: ../images/deployment_metadata.png

      :alt: Add deployment metadata

#. Click **Next**. The **Review** step appears.

#. Review the settings summary and click **Create** to create the new cluster.

#. The created cluster appears in the **Cluster List** page. Once the Kubernetes
   cluster is fully created on the host, the cluster status changes to "active".

.. note::

   If no valid DNS server is available on the system, K3s may fall back
   to using `8.8.8.8` (Google's public DNS). Ensure that your DNS configuration
   is properly set up on your system to avoid unexpected behavior.

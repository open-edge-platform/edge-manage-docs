Registry
===============================================
You can connect one or more registries to the |software_prod_name| service so you can easily add your applications to the service. There are two types of registries:

- **Helm\* Registries** hold Helm\* charts, packages consisting of YAML files and templates which convert into Kubernetes\* manifest files.
   Helm charts may refer to Docker\* images and/or a collection of files that describe a related set of Kubernetes resources.
   A single chart might be used to deploy something simple or something complex, like a full web application stack. The Helm chart typically specifies the names and locations of the images it loads.
- **Docker Registries** hold container images. Container images typically hold the executable binary that represents the application.
   This is inclusive of both containerized applications and virtual machines.

.. note::
   Intel recommends creating the Helm charts and noting the locations correctly so that the images are retrieved from the correct location when creating an application.

After setting up |software_prod_name|\ , by default, the "Internal Harbor" or "Internal Registry" is automatically created.
This Internal Registry is pre-populated and the necessary credentials to access it are created.

To view the available registries, click the **Deployments** tab and then click **Applications** on the left menu.
On the **Applications** page, click the **Registries** tab to view the available registries. You can also add a new registry by clicking **Add Registry**.

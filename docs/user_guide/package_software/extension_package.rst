Enhance Deployments
===========================================

Edge Orchestrator offers a catalog of useful pre-curated deployment packages that extend edge clusters to provide enhanced
operational capabilities or support various edge use cases.

**Catalog of Extension Deployment Packages**

These extension deployment packages are:

* :doc:`/user_guide/package_software/extensions/intel_gpu_package`
* :doc:`/user_guide/package_software/extensions/kubernetes_dashboard`
* :doc:`/user_guide/package_software/extensions/load_balancer`
* :doc:`/user_guide/package_software/extensions/trusted_compute_package`
* :doc:`/user_guide/package_software/extensions/usb_package`
* :doc:`/user_guide/package_software/extensions/virtualization_package`

**Deploy Extension Packages**

You can manually deploy pre-curated deployment packages in the catalog, like any other
deployment package in the Edge Orchestrator. Deploy the extension packages manually or
automatically, based on your requirements. For more information, see
:doc:`/user_guide/package_software/extensions/deploy_extension_package`.

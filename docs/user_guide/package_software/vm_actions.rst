You can perform the following actions on each VM:

* **Start**: Use this option to start the VM.

  .. note::
     **Start** is an automatic action. Therefore, the VM starts by default.

* **Stop**: Use this option to stop the VM.
* **Restart**: Use this option to re-start the VM.
* **Console**: Use this option to remotely access the VM. For example, to
    configure and troubleshoot your application. A new window with a console will open:

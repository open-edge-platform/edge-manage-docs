Import Deployment Package Steps
--------------------------------

If you have a YAML file with properties required for the deployment package, you can import it to |software_prod_name| and then set it up for deployment.

To import the deployment package:

1. In the **Deployment Package** page, click **Import Deployment Package**.
   The **Import Deployment Package** page appears:

     :alt: Import deployment package

2. In the **Import Deployment Package** page, you can choose to either drag and drop files or click **Browse Files**, to upload files.

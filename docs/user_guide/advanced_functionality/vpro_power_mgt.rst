Intel速 vPro速 Power Management
==============================

This guide describes how to use Intel速 vPro速 features for power management, including activation, performing power operations, and deactivation.

Activation of vPro Power Management
-----------------------------------


To use vPro power management features, the device must be provisioned and activated. Provisioning is a prerequisite for activation and enables vPro management capabilities on the device.

.. note::
   If the edge node is vPro-enabled, activation of vPro features occurs internally and automatically
   during device onboarding. No explicit user action is required to trigger vPro activation for 
   supported devices.

Power Operations
----------------

Once activated, you can perform various power operations such as power on, power off, reset, and cycle.
These operations can be managed through the user interface (UI): clicking 'Start' will power on the device, 'Stop' will power it off, and 'Reset' will reboot the device.

**UI Power Operations Example:**

**CLI Power Operations Example:**

.. code-block:: bash

   # Power On
   orch-cli set host <host-id>  --project <project_name> --power on

   # Power Off
   orch-cli set host <host-id>  --project <project_name> --power off

   # Reset
   orch-cli set host <host-id>  --project <project_name> --power reset

Replace `<host_id>` and `<project_name>` with your actual host-id and project name.

Deactivation of vPro Power Management
-------------------------------------

To deactivate vPro management features, the device must be deauthorized. 
Deauthorizing will deactivate the device and prevent from further management via vPro.

Troubleshooting
---------------

If you encounter issues during activation, power operations, or deactivation, 
refer to the logs or use the `--verbose` flag with `orch-cli` for more details.

For further assistance, consult the official documentation or contact support.

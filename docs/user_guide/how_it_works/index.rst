How it Works
==========================================

Key features of |software_prod_name| include:

**Infrastructure management** for lifecycle management of hosts, at scale.

- Create a custom hierarchical data model that matches your organization’s
  needs and manages hosts with policy-based management.
- Securely onboard and provision hosts remotely with cloud-based onboarding.

**Cluster orchestration** to Manage, monitor, and operate Kubernetes clusters
across hosts.

- Simplify cluster lifecycle management at all stages of operation.
- Streamline and standardize downstream cluster creation with Kubernetes
  templates.

**Application orchestration** to easily package, deploy, and monitor
cloud-native applications across distributed edge networks.

- Simplify deployment of complex solutions with flexible packaging, profiles,
  and custom deploy-time environments.
- Deploy, run, and manage container and virtual machine workloads side by side.
- Deploy software automatically based on metadata, or to a list of known
  targets.

**Observability** to gain visibility and insight at every level, from the
workload to the cluster.

- Health monitoring and alerting help you quickly identify and repair
  issues.

At a high level, you can use the following steps to use Edge Orchestrator.

      :alt: How it works

1. TO DO Set up Edge Infrastructure: Leverage Edge Orchestrator’s fleet
management and cluster orchestration capabilities to onboard and configure
hosts and form them into clusters.

2. TO DO Package and Deploy Applications: Use Edge Orchestrator’s application
orchestration features to import and package applications. Create profiles to
customize deploy-time environments. Configure conditions for automated
deployment.

3. **Deploy to Edge Automatically**: Packages are deployed to clusters based on
metadata, or to lists of custom targets. Edge Orchestrator automatically
distributes software updates and deploys the latest packages to new hosts as
they onboard.

4. TO DO Monitor Deployment:Observability features are woven throughout Edge
Orchestrator. Performance monitoring and alerting highlight critical issues,
while the unified dashboard offers visibility across the entire edge stack.

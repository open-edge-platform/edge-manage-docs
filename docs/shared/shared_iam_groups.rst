Edge Orchestrator Groups and Roles
==================================

.. AUTOGENERATED, DO NOT EDIT

This document lists all the groups and roles available in |software_prod_name|.

Instructions for creating users and assigning them to groups can be found in
:doc:`shared_gs_iam` and :doc:`shared_ht_iam_ext`.

In this document, the following syntax is used:

- ``<org-id>`` is replaced with an organization identifier. This is a UUID
  corresponding to the organization, and are created when the organization is
  created.

- ``<project-id>`` is replaced with a project identifier. This is a UUID
  corresponding to the project, and are created when the project is created.

.. note::

   There are also groups and roles with the ``M2M`` or ``service-account`` in
   their names.  These groups are used internally between services, and must
   not have users added to them.


Groups
------

|software_prod_name| creates the following user groups, by default. Some groups
are automatically created for every organization and project. With one
organization and one project created, there will be
13 groups.

You can place users in multiple groups; the users will be granted the union of
all permissions.  Within a single organization, you can place a user in
multiple project groups.

.. warning::

   Intel recommends placing users **only** in groups instead of granting
   them individual roles, which may change between software releases.

Edge Orchestrator Groups and Roles
==================================

.. AUTOGENERATED, DO NOT EDIT

This document lists all the groups and roles available in |software_prod_name|.

Instructions for creating users and assigning them to groups can be found in
TODO<add url>configure_users_groups_keycloak and :doc:`/shared/shared_ht_iam_ext`.

In this document, the following syntax is used:

- ``<org-id>`` is replaced with an organization identifier. This is a UUID
  corresponding to the organization, and are created when the organization is
  created.

- ``<project-id>`` is replaced with a project identifier. This is a UUID
  corresponding to the project, and are created when the project is created.

.. note::

   There are also groups and roles with the ``M2M`` or ``service-account`` in
   their names.  These groups are used internally between services, and must
   not have users added to them.


Groups
------

|software_prod_name| creates the following user groups, by default. Some groups
are automatically created for every organization and project. With one
organization and one project created, there will be 9 groups.

You can place users in multiple groups; the users will be granted the union of
all permissions.  Within a single organization, you can place a user in
multiple project groups.

.. warning::

   Intel recommends placing users **only** in groups instead of granting
   them individual roles, which may change between software releases.

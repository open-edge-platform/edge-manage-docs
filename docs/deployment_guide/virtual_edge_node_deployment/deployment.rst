Virtual Edge Node Deployment
============================

The Virtual Edge Node repository can be cloned on an Ubuntu\* OS version 22.04 or 24.04 machine. Then start creating virtual machines
using standalone scripts for testing the provisioning flow. For more details, see the README documents stored in the vm-provisioning component.


The VM-Provisioning tool is designed to deploy our Virtual Edge Node either On BareMetal physical servers or On Amazon Web Services\* (AWS\*) cloud, depending on your
specific needs and preferences. This tool provides scripts and instructions to streamline the process, focusing on using Edge Microvisor Toolkit or Ubuntu OS for deployment.
To get started, refer to the following sections for detailed instructions and guidance tailored to each deployment option:
